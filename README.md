## Step 1:
find some way to increase the resolution of data picture;\
emphasize the hand part and attenuate the background;\
cut out hand part from the picture;\
Low pass Filter?\
read data into dataset and use dataloader from PyTorch.

## Step 2:
A short literature survey?\
[Article1.pdf](Articles/Article1.pdf)\
[Article2.pdf](Articles/Article2.pdf)\
List reasonable different models.

## Step3:
Experiment with different hyper parameters.
  
## Step4:
Create new test data on our own, get results of accuracy.\
Maybe back to step 2, try another model.

## Step5:
Fine-tune the model finally chosen, we may need to check with professor or TAs.
