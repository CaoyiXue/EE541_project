# EE541_project
## Data Prepare
Download data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xJegrU82qZxjOIWu7CtHwWHVpiExpdSQ/view?usp=sharing)
The structure for this folder is 
<p align="center"><img src="images/data_folder.png" alt="data_folder" width="300" /></p>

We run our code on GoogleColab, so if you download this data file on the same directory with code, you can skip these code in the beginning.
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive/', force_remount=True)
```
```python
path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/EE541_project/"
```
